\d      Matches any decimal digit; 
            this is equivalent to the class [0-9]

\D      Matches any non-digit character; 
            this is equivalent to the class [^0-9]

\s      Matches any whitespace character; 
            this is equivalent to the class [ \t\n\r\f\v]

\S      Matches any non-whitespace character; 
            this is equivalent to the class [^ \t\n\r\f\v]

\w      Matches any alphanumeric character; 
            this is equivalent to the class [a-zA-Z0-9_]

\W      Matches any non-alphanumeric character; 
            this is equivalent to the class [^a-zA-Z0-9_]

These sequences can be included inside a character class. 
    For example, [\s,.] is a character class that will match any whitespace character, or ',' or '.'.
